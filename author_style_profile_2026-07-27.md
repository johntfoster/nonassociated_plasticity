# Author profile for repository edits

Date revised: 2026-07-28

## Use

Read this profile before every repository edit. Apply the prose rules to all
manuscript text, captions, tables, source comments, documentation, and
agent-workflow material. For an edit containing no prose, use the profile to
avoid unnecessary terminology, notation, commentary, and scope changes.

This is an editing profile, not a license to imitate defects in working drafts.
Project instructions, accepted notation, and the author's explicit directions
take precedence.

## Evidence base

Three works are the primary stylistic exemplars:

1. *A finite deformation formulation for reacting porous media with volume
   change* — July 20, 2026
   (`ReactingMixture/build/main.pdf`);
2. *Revisiting finite deformation poromechanics: Deriving a nonlinear Biot
   coefficient from first principles* — June 22, 2026
   (`Poromechanics_Biot/main.pdf`);
3. *Dynamic Crack Initiation Toughness: Experiments and Peridynamic Modeling* —
   Ph.D. dissertation, Purdue University, December 2009
   (`Dissertation/JTF_dissertation_deposit_rev5.pdf`).

The dissertation is the principal example for sustained exposition: overall
roadmaps, chapter openings, transitions between experimental and theoretical
material, detailed derivations, validation discussions, chapter conclusions,
and the final separation of demonstrated results from future work. The two
recent articles carry greater weight for current terminology, sentence economy,
and presentation of finite-deformation mixture theory.

The other recent first-author PDFs were inspected only as supporting evidence.
`FourPhaseReactingMixture/main.pdf` is a compact manuscript organized primarily
around equations, while `Gypsum/main.pdf` and `Serpentization/main.pdf` are
working derivation notes. Their draft artifacts are not treated as authorial
preferences.

## Characteristic voice

- Begin with the physical system or mathematical task. In an article-level
  introduction, establish the application and governing difficulty first. In a
  derivation, begin directly with the body, mixture, motion, balance, or
  constitutive quantity under consideration.
- At the beginning of a long section or chapter, state its purpose and identify
  how it uses the result established immediately before it. Give a roadmap when
  several distinct tasks follow.
- State the central contribution early and positively. Typical paper-level
  constructions are “We develop...,” “We derive...,” and “The central
  contribution is....”
- Move from a familiar continuum-mechanics statement to the required
  extension. Give the physical reason for the extension before its detailed
  notation.
- Keep the derivation equation-forward. Introduce the operation, display the
  equation, define its symbols locally, and state the immediate consequence.
- Use concrete mathematical subjects and verbs: “the balance gives,” “the
  constraint yields,” “substitution produces,” “summing the phase equations
  gives,” and “the small-strain limit recovers....”
- Interpret a formal result physically after deriving it. When useful, follow
  that interpretation with a limiting case, benchmark, or experimentally
  observable consequence.
- Explain procedural choices by connecting them to the quantity being measured,
  derived, or validated. Include enough detail for the reader to understand why
  the chosen construction serves that purpose.
- Distinguish derived results, constitutive choices, specializations, and
  assumptions explicitly.
- Conclude by restating the construction, its principal physical consequence,
  the checks or reductions performed, and the next scientifically meaningful
  extension.
- For a long work, close major sections locally instead of postponing every
  interpretation to the final conclusion. Use the final conclusion to assemble
  those results into the overall contribution.

## Sentence and paragraph habits

- Use ordinary technical English and mostly moderate-length sentences.
  Technical paragraphs may be compact, but each should perform one recognizable
  task.
- Use first-person plural for paper-level actions and choices. Within a
  derivation, prefer the equation, balance, constraint, or physical quantity as
  the subject.
- Use short transitions such as “Here,” “Thus,” “Then,” “Substituting,”
  “Summing,” and “In this limit” when they identify a real mathematical step.
  Vary them rather than repeating the same transition in adjacent paragraphs.
- Place definitions immediately before or after first use. A reader should not
  have to search several paragraphs ahead to decode a symbol.
- Let equations remain grammatical parts of their sentences. The prose before
  a display should say why the equation is needed; the prose after it should
  say what follows.
- Prefer a paragraph that states a claim, supplies the mathematical or physical
  basis, and gives the implication over a paragraph that inventories features.
- Use a concrete example or analogy when it makes an unfamiliar formal
  distinction visible, but return promptly to the governing variables and
  equations.

## Just-in-time exposition

- Introduce notation only when the corresponding physical idea or derivational
  step becomes active.
- Do not collect symbols, constitutive quantities, or terminology in an early
  section merely because they will be needed later.
- Define a symbol within one or two paragraphs of its first substantive use.
  If a far-future closure must be mentioned, describe its role anecdotally
  without using its undeveloped notation.
- Refer to an appendix when a detailed prerequisite would interrupt the main
  argument. State the result needed in the body and leave the full derivation
  in the appendix.
- Use an appendix for supporting derivations, supplementary definitions, and
  validation details that are necessary for reproducibility but would obscure
  the main line of argument.
- In an equation paragraph, use this order when possible: physical purpose,
  equation, local definitions, consequence, and limiting interpretation.
- Do not introduce a named helper quantity when the existing primitive
  variables state the result clearly.

## Positioning prior work and the present contribution

- Describe affirmatively what a cited theory, experiment, or model establishes.
  Then state what the present paper derives or applies.
- Do not build novelty by listing what earlier work lacks, what the current
  model is not, or what inspected formulations fail to contain.
- Avoid constructions such as “unlike prior models,” “does not present,”
  “has not developed,” “not merely,” and “not ad hoc.”
- Use negation only when it conveys necessary scientific content: a
  mathematical condition, an operative assumption, a distinction between
  easily confused quantities, an excluded physical mechanism, or a limitation
  that prevents misinterpretation.
- Do not insert commentary from author-agent discussions, drafting history,
  prior versions, review strategy, or discarded formulations into the paper.

## Vocabulary for the current manuscript

Prefer plain physical descriptions when a more abstract term adds no precision:

- “admissible saturations” or “saturations whose sum is one,” rather than
  “saturation simplex”;
- “\(N-1\) independent composition changes,” rather than “composition tangent
  space”;
- “independent zero-sum component fluxes,” rather than “zero-sum flux
  subspace”;
- “states satisfying the constraints,” rather than “constraint manifold”;
- “held-fixed state,” or the explicit held-fixed variables, rather than
  “constitutive submanifold”;
- “eliminate the dependent component” or “use the reference component,” rather
  than “project onto the composition space” unless an actual projection is
  used;
- “active phases” and “phase appearance or disappearance” when
  complementarity terminology is unnecessary.

Retain standard terms such as “variational principle,” “Onsager relation,”
“electrochemical potential,” “frame indifference,” and “Legendre transform”
when they name the actual theory. State their local role in plain language when
they first become relevant.

## Draft artifacts not to imitate

- Conversational work-note phrasing such as “we'll rewrite,” “we now fix,” “as
  requested,” “this repair,” or “for reasons that will be made clear.”
- Placeholder references, incomplete captions, compressed sentence fragments,
  and grammatical errors present in draft PDFs.
- Abrupt formalism before the reader knows the physical or mathematical
  question.
- Repeated “Thus,” “Hence,” or “Therefore” where the logical relation can be
  stated directly.
- Unsupported claims of novelty, generality, completeness, or experimental
  accessibility.
- Long literature inventories whose only purpose is to contrast the paper with
  absent features.
- Dissertation-era habits that weaken current prose, including excessive
  authorial qualification, informal judgments such as “obvious” or “very
  simple,” and repeated announcements that a result is novel.

## Technical preservation rules

- Preserve accepted equations, symbols, labels, citations, and constitutive
  distinctions unless the task explicitly changes them or a technical audit
  identifies an error.
- Preserve the distinction between the traditional electrochemical affinity
  and the neutral, temperature-weighted reaction coefficient.
- Preserve the transfer potential \(\tau\) and the algebraic recovery of
  \(L_\xi^\alpha\).
- Preserve qualifications required for gauge invariance, two-temperature
  reactions, phase transfer, and finite-deformation electromechanics.
- Improve the explanation adjacent to an equation before adding notation.

## Pre-edit and review checklist

Before editing:

1. What exact reader-facing problem does this edit solve?
2. Which symbols and concepts are already defined at this location?
3. Can the change use existing notation and terminology?
4. Does the proposed prose state what the theory does, without discussing what
   earlier drafts or other models do not do?

After editing:

1. Is every new symbol defined within one or two paragraphs of first
   substantive use?
2. Does each forward reference remain anecdotal unless the cited equation or
   definition is nearby?
3. Does each equation paragraph explain purpose, local notation, and immediate
   consequence?
4. Does the prose distinguish definitions, derived restrictions, constitutive
   closures, specializations, and validation needs?
5. Were accepted equations, labels, citations, and thermodynamic distinctions
   preserved?
6. Is all drafting-history and discussion-local commentary absent?
7. Does any sentence establish importance by saying what another formulation
   lacks or what the present model is not? If so, rewrite it affirmatively.
